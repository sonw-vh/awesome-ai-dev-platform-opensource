## Overview

**Objective — Security Through Openness**
AIxBlock combines decentralized compute, open‑source models, data engines and human validators into a low‑code environment for end‑to‑end AI and workflow automation. Our goal is to **identify and remediate vulnerabilities quickly and transparently** while crediting and rewarding the researchers who make that possible.

* All vulnerability discussion and fixes are public (issues & PRs).
* Rewards scale with **impact *and* fix quality** – submit the bug **and** a working patch to maximize your payout.
* We follow the \[CVSS v3.1] qualitative scale for severity (see footnote 1).

| **High**     | 7.0 – 8.9  | Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Authentication Bypass, Unauthorized access to decentralized compute or workflow triggers                          | **\$450** cash + 1,000 worth of token & rev‑share          |
| **Medium**   | 4.0 – 6.9  | Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), CSRF affecting workflow actions, Webhook misconfiguration                                              | **\$200** cash + 500 worth of token & rev‑share            |
| **Low**      | 0.1 – 3.9  | Minor configuration errors, Non-impactful XSS, Non-sensitive information disclosure                                                      | 200 worth of token & rev‑share                             |

\***Token: payouts redeemable on or one day after TGE.**

⚠️ **Note**: To be eligible for the **full reward**, researchers must not only report the vulnerability but also submit a **valid Pull Request (PR)** that includes a **concrete fix directly in our open-source codebase**. PRs must contain an **actual code-level resolution** (not just a placeholder, comment, or general suggestion) that addresses the root cause of the issue. Submissions that only create a PR to satisfy process requirements without providing a real fix or actionable change in code will **not be considered for full rewards**.
If only a report is submitted **without a valid code fix**, or the PR does **not provide a working solution**, the researcher will receive **50% of the listed reward**.

**Bonus:** Additional for reports with detailed PoCs or vulnerabilities found in new features (e.g., automation workflows, MCP integration, decentralized compute).

**No Reward:** Duplicate reports, out-of-scope issues, or vulnerabilities with no security impact.

**Payments:** Cash Rewards can be paid via either bank transfer in fiat currency or in stablecoins (USDC) as cryptocurrency payment, distributed at the end of the bounty campaign once the total cash rewards pool reaches 10,000 USD, will be announced publicly on all of our channels. Token rewards shall be distributed on our TGE date or 1 day after our TGE date. Please follow us to make sure you don't miss it.

Total pool: **\$10 000** cash + 30 000 worth of AIxBlock tokens.
